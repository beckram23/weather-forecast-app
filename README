This application retrieves weather information from www.weather.com. A part of this application is inspired from a project that assigned students who had taken Web Technologies course at USC in Spring 2011. The project specification stated using only Perl regular expressions. But my implementations used XML libraries. I had also developed an alternate implementation that would connect to and use MySQL database. With either of the two implementations an user can create an account and log in. Upon logging in the Perl script will fetch the forecast from www.weather.com based on the information provided by the user while creating the account. The other part of this application is finding out whether it is raining in an area and get precipitation information forecast for the next 6 hours. This is implemented by just providing the zip code of the area. The information is retrieved from www.weather.com .If the zip code is unknown, the user can get the list of zip codes associated with the location from www.zip-codes.com (eg: San Francisco, CA would fetch about 60 zip codes. The user can select the zip code from the list). Apart from fetching results, the application has Javascript functions that performs validation functions and prevents invalid data to be passed to the Perl script (eg: zip codes can have numeric digits only.).

Updated code - The quickpeek.pl has been updated to retrieve flickr images corressponding the latitude and longitude of the location. Please use Flickr API libraries and Data::Dumper to parse the response. Also the open source Javascript for Google Maps has been used to display the location on Google Maps.
